## Dutch and Vickery auctions on the Ethereum blockchain

This project involves the implementation of two types of auction systems using Ethereum blockchain.  One is Vickery and the other, to be chosen between Dutch and English, is the first one.  The Dutch auction consists in a auction where the good price is initially set to an high value than gradually decreased until a given threshold.  The first bidder who sends a sufficient amount will be the winner of the auction.  The Vickery instead is a blind auction where bidders initially submits a commitment of payment, and only after the auction end the bidder who submitted the highest valid commitment will be the winner and will pay the second price.
